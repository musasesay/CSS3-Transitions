HTML has a special element for creating ordered lists, or numbered-style lists.

Ordered lists start with a <ol> element. Then they contain some number of <li> elements.

For example:

<ol>
  <li>Garfield</li>
  <li>Sylvester</li>
</ol>
would create a numbered list of "Garfield" and "Sylvester".

Create an ordered list of the top 3 things cats hate the most.
